### cf-refURLs

Greetings! The following content is one method to shorten URLs via your own domain name using Cloudflare.

Upon calling a pre-designated URL path, the path key will return the associated URL using a 301 redirect.

Example: 

Visiting my domain with an appended path of "/linkedin" results in triggering a 301 redirect to the value associated to that path.

In this specific instance, the user would be redirected to https://linkedin.com/in/insecurity

Key		Value
/linkedin	https://linkedin.com/in/insecurity
/github		https://github.com/xegenix
/blog		https://nullidle.com
